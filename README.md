# The Odin Project - Calculator

**Motivation**
This calculator project was made to compile all HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge gathered in The Odin Project - Foundations.

**Features**
- The calculator utilizes CSS grids and flexbox to shape the calculator UI. Using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulations, a functional calculator with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functionalities was made.
- In addition, floating point decimals up to 3 decimal places are allowed, rounding when overflows occur.
- As well, the exponential operators are allowed (e+, e-) if it was determined through a calculation (user cannot manually input exponential operators).
- Most importantly, recursive calculations are implemented using the equality opertor, whereby the previous operation is continuously applied with each equality input.

**Learnings**
- I improved my coding practices, writing neater code, isolating specific functionalities, and writing more functions for task delegation within the program.
- I made better use of HTML attributes to isolate operator buttons vs number buttons.
